    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Prepare two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Oil an 8 inch by 8 inch casserole dish with olive oil.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the flavours have blended, about 10-15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add zucchini slices. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Arrange zucchini slices on prepared baking sheets in an even layer. Bake until zucchini is light golden brown and fork-tender, about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to 375 degrees. Spread 1/4 cup tomato sauce over the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Arrange 1/3 of the zucchini in an even layer over the tomato sauce. Spoon 1/3 of the remaining tomato sauce over zucchini. Sprinkle 1/4 cup parmesan cheese over the layer, followed by the 1/4 cup mozzarella. Repeat layers with remaining 2/3 zucchini slices, tomato sauce, and cheeses.</li>
        <li>Bake until browned and bubbling, about 30-35 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
